Flask Learning Notes:

To install virtual enviroment: # allows all packages to be kept seperate for different projects
    py -m venv testenv          # testenv is the name of the virtual enviroment


To activate the enviroment:
    testenv\Scripts\activate


Set enviroment variable: # this step allows flask to know what file to look for when it needs to run 
    set FLASK_APP=app.py   
    # later when you run flask server then no need to mention name of module

To Exit virtual enviroment:
    deactivate

if __name__=="__main__": # with this the file can run directly without flask run command
    app.run() 

If file name is something other than app then:
    export FLASK_APP=<name_of_file>.py
    flask run

To use Debug mode: 
    export FLASK_DEBUG=1
    flask run

To install with pipenv which has both pip and virtualenv:
    1. first install pipenv:
        pip install pipenv
    
    2. Install flask:
        pipenv install flask
    
    3. Once install run:
        pipenv shell # this will start virtualenv  with the name of the folder that you are in
